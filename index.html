<p> The Manhattan Project was a research and development undertaking during World War II that produced the first nuclear weapons. It was led by</p>
<p>the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of Major General</p>
<p>Leslie Groves of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory that</p>
<p>designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the Manhattan District as its first headquarters were in</p>
<p>Manhattan; the placename gradually superseded the official codename, Development of Substitute Materials, for the entire project. Along the,</p> 
<p>the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, Tube Alloys. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than</p> 
<p>130,000 people and cost nearly US$2 billion (equivalent to about $23 billion in 2020).[1] Over 90 percent of the cost was for building</p>
<p>factories and to produce fissile material, with less than 10 percent for development and production of the weapons. Research and production</p>
<p>took place at more than thirty sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.</p>

<p> The Project let to the development of two types of atomic bombs, both developed concurrently, during the war: a relatively simple gun-type</p> 
<p>fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium, so a</p> 
<p>simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Because</p> 
<p>it was chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and had almost the same mass, separating the two proved difficult. Three</p> 
<p>methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Scientists conducted most of this work at the Clinton</p> 
<p>Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.</p>
  
<p> In parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium, which researchers at the University of California, Berkeley,</p>
<p>discovered in 1940. After the feasibility of the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, was demonstrated in 1942</p>
<p>at the Metallurgical Laboratory in the University of Chicago, the Project designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the</p>
<p>production reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington state, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium</p> 
<p>was then chemically separated from the uranium, using the bismuth phosphate process. The Fat Man plutonium implosion-type weapon was</p>
<p>developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.</p>
  
<p> The project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the German nuclear weapon project. Through Operation Alsos, Manhattan Project</p>
<p>personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German</p>
<p>scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet atomic spies successfully penetrated the program.</p>
  
<p> The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb during the Trinity test, conducted at New Mexico's Alamogordo Bombing</p>
<p>and Gunnery Range on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,</p>
<p>respectively, with Manhattan Project personnel serving as bomb assembly technicians and weaponeers on the attack aircraft. In the immediate</p>
<p>postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads, developed new weapons,</p>
<p>promoted the development of the network of national laboratories, supported medical research into radiology and laid the foundations for the</p>
<p>nuclear navy. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the United States Atomic</p>
<p>Energy Commission in January 1947.</p>

<p> A black hole and its shadow have been captured in an image for the first time, a historic feat by an international network of radio</p>
<p>telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). EHT is an international collaboration whose support in the U.S. includes the National</p>
<p>Science Foundation.</p>

<p> A black hole is an extremely dense object from which no light can escape. Anything that comes within a black hole’s “event horizon,” its 
<p>point of no return, will be consumed, never to re-emerge, because of the black hole’s unimaginably strong gravity. By its very nature, a 
<p>black hole cannot be seen, but the hot disk of material that encircles it shines bright. Against a bright backdrop, such as this disk, a 
<p>black hole appears to cast a shadow.   

<p> The stunning new image shows the shadow of the supermassive black hole in the center of Messier 87 (M87), an elliptical galaxy some 
<p>55 million light-years from Earth. This black hole is 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun. Catching its shadow involved eight ground-based 
<p>radio telescopes around the globe, operating together as if they were one telescope the size of our entire planet. 

<p> To complement the EHT findings, several NASA spacecraft were part of a large effort, coordinated by the EHT’s Multiwavelength Working Group,
<p>to observe the black hole using different wavelengths of light. As part of this effort, NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory, Nuclear 
<p>Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory space telescope missions, all attuned to different varieties of 
<p>X-ray light, turned their gaze to the M87 black hole around the same time as the EHT in April 2017. NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope 
<p>was also watching for changes in gamma-ray light from M87 during the EHT observations. If EHT observed changes in the structure of the black
<p>hole’s environment, data from these missions and other telescopes could be used to help figure out what was going on.  

<p> While NASA observations did not directly trace out the historic image, astronomers used data from NASA’s Chandra and NuSTAR satellites to 
<p>measure the X-ray brightness of M87’s jet. Scientists used this information to compare their models of the jet and disk around the black hole 
<p>with the EHT observations. Other insights may come as researchers continue to pore over these data. 
  
<p> NASA space telescopes have previously studied a jet extending more than 1,000 light-years away from the center of M87. The jet is made of 
<p>particles traveling near the speed of light, shooting out at high energies from close to the event horizon. The EHT was designed in part to 
<p>study the origin of this jet and others like it. A blob of matter in the jet called HST-1, discovered by Hubble astronomers in 1999, has 
<p>undergone a mysterious cycle of brightening and dimming.

<p> Chandra, NuSTAR, Swift and Fermi, as well as NASA’s Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) experiment on the International Space 
<p>Station, also looked at the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, called Sagittarius A*, in coordination with EHT.</p>
